    <h1>My favorite city: Kyoto, Japan!</h1>
    <p>Kyoto is a city where ancient traditions and modern life blend in perfect harmony.
        It was once the capital of Japan and is still known as the heart of Japanese culture.
        Walking through its quiet streets feels like traveling back in time. </p>

        I love Kyoto for its peaceful temples, colorful shrines, and beautiful gardens that change with every season.
        In spring, cherry blossoms decorate the city like pink snow.
        In autumn, fiery red maple leaves light up the hills.
        My favorite spot is the Fushimi Inari Shrine, famous for its endless path of bright orange gates.
